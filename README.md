# 🌱 Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System Using IoT

A smart, IoT-based solution that automates and optimizes greenhouse conditions to improve crop yield and reduce manual labor. Developed as a final-year B.Tech project at Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College and presented at the National Conference on Knowledge, Innovations, and Technologies for Sustainability (NCKITS – 2022).

## 📌 Overview

This project uses an embedded system (Arduino UNO) integrated with multiple sensors to monitor and control greenhouse parameters like temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture, air quality, and rainfall. Data is uploaded to the **Ubidots IoT platform**, enabling real-time access for farmers via mobile devices. Actuators like fans, pumps, and lights respond automatically to maintain optimal conditions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino UNO, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
- **Sensors**:
  - DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity)
  - LDR (Light Intensity)
  - Soil Moisture Sensor
  - MQ4 (Air Quality - CO₂)
  - Rain Sensor
- **Actuators**: Servo Motor, DC Fan, Relay-controlled Bulb and Pump
- **IoT Platform**: [Ubidots](https://ubidots.com/)
- **Languages**: Embedded C (Arduino IDE)
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, Ubidots Dashboard

## 💡 Features

- 🌡️ Automated temperature control using DC fan
- 💧 Soil moisture sensing & irrigation control via water pump
- 💡 Light sensing using LDR with automatic lighting
- 🌫️ CO₂ level detection via air quality sensor
- 🌧️ Rainfall detection with automatic window adjustment using servo
- 📲 Real-time data transmission to Ubidots cloud
- 📩 SMS/Email alerts for key environmental changes

## 📷 Hardware Setup

The system consists of:
- Arduino UNO
